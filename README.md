# Dummy Feat Mod for Baldur’s Gate 3

This mods adds a Feat that … well, doesn’t do anything.

## WHY⁈

I was looking for a way to implement the common house rule of a free feat for 
each character at level 1.

_Technically_ you can do that _very easily_ in Baldur’s Gate 3. Unfortunately 
adding Feats to race progression flat out does not work.

What you _can_ do is add extra Feats to the class progression, but not at level 
one. You also cannot specify that you should get a Feat only when the current 
class is _not_ multiclassed.

So, you can give every class a free Feat at level two. But then you get more 
Feats than intended; this is where this mod comes in. Pick a Feat at level two 
in your first/main class, then pick the Dummy Feat for all additional classes.

## How Do I Get Feats At Level Two?

There are several mods for that. Personally I use [Extra Feats at Low 
Levels](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/952) in the “2nd Level Only” 
variety.

## It doesn’t work!

Well, you probably messed something up then. This is as simple as it gets. 
I could cobble the thing together in about an hour from “I have no idea how this 
works” to working mod.

You can still [open an issue](https://git.alternerd.tv/bg3-dummy-feat) if you 
want. Include as much info as possible and I will take a look.
